# Refunds, Returns, and Reconciliation Policy

## 1. Overview

We strive to ensure satisfaction with your purchase. We use an Escrow system, releasing funds to third-party merchants only after you confirm receipt and inspection of your product. Please verify your product upon receipt to avoid any issues. If you are unsatisfied after verification, you may return the product within one week of receipt for repair, replacement, or credit, subject to the conditions below. This policy applies to products purchased directly from One Ziko and from Third-Party Sellers on Maliketi eXchange.

## 2. Standard Returns Policy

### 2.1 Preparing Your Product for Return

To ensure prompt processing of your return request, please follow these guidelines:
1. Safely and securely package your product for protection during transit.
2. Clearly mark your return reference number on the outside of the parcel.
3. Include all accessories and parts originally sold with the product.

Failure to meet these requirements may delay processing or result in denial of your return.

### 2.2 Exchange Policy

1. **Fashion and Sportswear**: Products can be exchanged for a different size or color variation if available.
2. **Unboxed Deals, Reconditioned, or Used Products**: Exchanges can only be made for variations of the same product if available.

We will collect the product and deliver the requested variation at no charge. If no variation is available, your account will be credited within 10 days, or you may opt for a refund.

### 2.3 Inspection and Validation

We reserve the right to inspect returned products to validate the return. For tips on ensuring your product is returnable, please refer to our Help Centre.

## 4. Defective Products

We aim to deliver high-quality, defect-free products. A defect is a significant imperfection or a characteristic that makes a product less acceptable than reasonably expected.

### 4.1 Non-Defect Conditions

The following conditions will not be considered defects and are not covered:
1. Normal wear and tear.
2. Damage from negligence, misuse, or incorrect usage.
3. Damage from electrical surges or corrosion.
4. Lack of adequate care.
5. Unauthorized alterations.
6. Specification mismatches that are accurately described.
7. Handling or repackaging signs in Unboxed Deals or used products.

## 5. Manufacturer Warranty

Some products come with a manufacturer’s warranty. If a product covered by a manufacturer’s warranty turns out to be defective or otherwise of poor quality:
1. Please contact the relevant supplier or manufacturer directly using the contact details provided with the product or in the warranty documentation.

## 6. Charges and Refunds

1. **Partial Returns**: If returning a defective product without all accessories/parts, we may refuse the return, replace only the item returned, or credit/refund only the value of the returned item.
2. **Non-Compliant Returns**: You may be responsible for the cost of collecting and returning the product if it does not comply with this policy.
3. **Abandoned Products**: If a refused return is not collected within 30 days due to your unavailability or refusal to accept delivery, the product will be considered abandoned and may be disposed of accordingly.
4. **Donations and Goodwill Credit**: Non-refundable under any circumstances.
5. **Refund Methods**: Refunds will be issued using any payment methods available on your profile.
